## Basic instructions

1. Create your own **private** repository from this repo by hitting the "Use this template" button at the top right of the page.
    - Forks are discouraged because of visibility issues.
2. Add me ([@tolstenko](https://github.com/tolstenko)) as a collaborator on your **private** repository;
3. Clone your repository to your local machine;
4. Open your favorite IDE (CLion, Visual Studio) and open as CMake project;
5. Enable / disable the assignments you want to work on in the `CMakeLists.txt` file;
6. Select as target your assignment (e.g. `assignment01`);
7. Implement the missing parts where it says "YOUR CODE HERE";
8. Run the tests;
9. Commit and push your code to GitHub;
10. Submit the URL to your private repository on Canvas. Submit even if you are not passing all tests so you can get partial credit.

## General recommendations

* You are encouraged to also make commits much more frequently than this, earlier in development. Just don't be surprised when seeing an X on GitHub since not all of the tests will pass;
* Remember to keep your repo in sync with the original one by pulling changes from the original repo weekly;
* Run the build target `fix-format`, or check the github-ci result to ensure you are following the `google` styleguide;

## Directory Structure and Files

- `/`: Main directory including this `README.md`, and the `LICENSE.md` file;
- `/lib`: Libraries for drawing the charts. There's no need to touch this;
- `/cmake`: CMake extra files. Don't touch this;
- `/assignmentXX`: assignment root directory. Read the child `README.md` file for more details;
- `/assignmentXX/README.md`: assignment description and instructions;
- `/assignmentXX/CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file for the specific assignment. Don't touch this;
- `/assignmentXX/questions.txt`: assignment questions that you should answer if present;
- `/CMakelists.txt`: Root CMake file, change the last lines of it to enable / disable assignments you want to work on here. By default, all assignments are enabled. You should open/target this CMake file as a project in your IDE.

## Building and Running

### IDEs

note: Tested on CLion and Visual Studio. Git should be installed and available on your PATH. If you are unsure, open terminal and type git. If not found, install it.

1. Open the `CMakeLists.txt` file as a project in your preferred IDE;
2. On the targets, select the assignment you want to work on (e.g. `assignment01`);
3. Build and run the target;

Some IDEs (e.g. CLion) allow you to run the automated tests directly from the IDE and debug them.

### Terminal

Open your terminal app and navigate to the root directory of your repository. 

To configure the project using  `build` as cmake build folder, run:

```bash
cmake -H . -B build
```

To build a specific assignment where XX is the number of the assignment, run:

```bash
cmake --build build --target assignmentXX
```

To run the assignment (for windows replace `/` for `\`, and add `.exe` at the end of the file), run:

```bash
./build/assignmentXX/assignmentXX
```

To build the assignment tests, run:

```bash
cmake --build build --target assignmentXX_tests
```

To run the assignment tests, run:

```bash
./build/assignments/assignmentXX/assignmentXX_tests
```
