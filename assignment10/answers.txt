1. To change it to a maximum spanning tree, you would push the largest weights first and pop the highest weight edges rather than lowest.
2. An MST connects all the vertices with minimum total weight and no cycling to make the shortest tree, while the travelling salesman problem finds a singular minimum weight cycle by visiting each vertex one time and then returning to the start, making the shortest loop.

4. When a priority queue is used it is O(e Log V), while without it is O(V^2). There is a difference because using a priority queue makes selecting the next smallest edge faster.
5. The algorithm is greedy because it picks the smallest edge connecting to a new vertex, which are locally optimal choices that form the globally optimal tree. Used this source for the info: https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/newlectures/lecture13.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com
6. The Bellman Ford algorithm was meant for finding the shortest path from a single vertex, like dijkstra's algorithm. This was discovered by Shimbel, but is named after Bellman and Ford who were the ones who published the algorithm. Found from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm
